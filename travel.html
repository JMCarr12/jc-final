    <h3>Summary</h3>
    <p>
    I have been very fortunate to have traveled quite a bit (and hope to more in the future!)
    <br>My family took my older brother and I to Europe for five weeks when I was nine but
    <br>despite the trip of a lifetime, the travel bug did not bite me until years later
    <br>when I studied abroad in Vienna, Austria in the fall of 2007. Once I graduated
    <br>in the spring of 2009 I packed my bags and moved to Zurich, Switzerland and that's
    <br>when I really took off. I lived in Zurich for a year and then spent the next two
    <br>years living, working, and traveling around the globe.
